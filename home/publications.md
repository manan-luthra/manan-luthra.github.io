## Stewart Platform: The 6 DOF Parallel Manipulator 
### 3rd International Conference on Intelligent Circuits and Systems – Taylor & Francis Group (2021)
Abstract:
This paper deals with a specialized parallel manipulator having six degrees of freedom, commonly known as the Stewart platform. It shows the different prototypes that already exist, their different applications and their acceptance in the industrial world. A comparison between serial and parallel manipulators has also been drawn. Apart from this, the inverse kinematics of the parallel manipulator has been studied briefly.

Key topics covered:
- Components of a Stewart platform
- Major Applications 
- Kinematics (Forward and Inverse)
- Control

## Sonic Fire Fighting System 
### 2020 IEEE International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics – IEEE 
Abstract:
In today's world, a lot of innovation has been going on in the field of fire safety and management. Various types of extinguishers are becoming famous in the market. But they are mostly either based on water or chemicals. This research work is aimed at introducing a type of fire extinguisher that eradicates the use of both water as well as chemicals by using sound/acoustic waves, thus saving resources as well as preventing equipment and health damage caused by chemicals. (Furthermore, this research work will also highlight the challenges faced by the implementation of this concept in a practical scenario).

Key topics covered:
- Basic Principle involved 
- Approach 
- Research Focus 
- Experimental Prototype 
- Limitations

## Trustworthiness of Artificial Intelligence 
### International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communication Systems – IEEE  
Abstract:
This paper discusses the need for a trustworthy AI, along with the ethics which are required to keep that trust intact. AI has a lot of benefits when it comes to societal, individual or cultural development. But any mistake in either the development or in the working phase of the AI system can be disastrous, especially when human lives are involved. The main goal of this paper is to understand what really makes an Artificial Intelligence system trustworthy.

Key topics covered:
- Framework and Foundation of a Trustworthy AI
- Rights as a Foundation for Trusted AI
- Ethical Principles in the Context of AI Systems
- Trustworthy AI Requirements
- Realization of a Trustworthy AI
- Assessing Trustworthy AI

## Review on Implementing Smart Water Grid for Smart Cities in India: Challenges and Solutions
### 2019 5th International Conference on Advanced Computing & Communication Systems (ICACCS)
Abstract:
In today's world we are facing an acute shortage of resources like Fuel, Clean Water, Shelter and Hygienic Food. And only 0.1%, of the total Water present on Earth, is available as clean and fresh water to the living beings. Also the human population on Earth is increasing day by day and most of the sources of clean water are depleting. Ground water levels are going down rapidly and the pollution of ground water by chemicals [Water and Soil Pollution] has alarming effects on the sustainable growth of Human Beings. Most of the clean water is wasted by the households and this usually takes place in Modern societies and recent establishments. This review paper discusses the need for water management, measures to control water scarcity and the idea of smart water grid for conservation of water and the challenges in its implementation in India.

Key topics covered:
- Reasons for water scarcity
- Effect of water scarcity
- Measures to conrol water scarcity
- Challenges hindering in establishment of smart grid system in India
