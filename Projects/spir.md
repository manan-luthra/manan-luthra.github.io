## Breathing Sensory Feedback Device for Lung Transplants

Abstract: 
A digital spirometer is developed along with an application that introduces a certain level of gamification to the otherwise tedious practice. The immediate objective of this product is to engage the patients through gamification during their breathing sets and consequently improve their lung strength. The spirometer connects wirelessly with the app via Bluetooth. An illustration is shown on the mobile screen as per the patientâ€™s lung output.
